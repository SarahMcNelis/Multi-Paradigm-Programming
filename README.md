# Multi-Paradigm-Programming

This repository contains a project I completed as part of this module for my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics. 

<br>

## What are Multi-Paradigm-Programming languages? 

Programming paradigms are different ways of formatting or organising code in a given language. For example, Python can be used in a procedural manner using relationships via structs or it can be used in a object orientated manner by assiging values to an object and calling it. 

<br>

## The Project

Build 3 programmes of a shop simulation. One using C procedural programming, one using python procedural programming and one using python object orientated programming. 

Functionality:
- The shop CSV should hold the initial cash value for the shop.
- Read in customer orders from a CSV file (Include their name, budget, desired product and quantity).
- The shop must be able to process the orders of the customer.
- Update the cash in the shop based on money received (Shop state must be consistent)
â€“ Know whether or not the shop can fill an order (ie. create customer orders which cannot be filled and throw appropriate error)
- Operate in a live mode, where the user can enter a product by name, specify a quantity, and pay for it. The user should
be able to buy many products in this way.

## Repository Contents


1. `c`: this folder contains a shop simulation written in C procedural programming language. There is also an execution file. 

2. `customers`: this folder contains 4 specific customer csv files which contain their name, budget, desired product and quantity.   

3. `python oop`: this folder contains a shop simulation written using python object orientated programming.

4. `python proc`: this folder contains a shop simulation written using python procedural programming.  

5. `customer.csv`: this file is used for the live shop. 

6. `readme.txt`: contains a brief of the shop simulation ie. how the shop menu works. 

7. `report.pdf`: this document contains a report which I explain the theory behind each programming paradigm. It also contains references used in my researh. 

8. `stock.csv`: this file is used to maintain the state and stock levels of the shop.

## Credit

For this project I relied on my lecturer's notes, lectures and continuous assessment assignments. I built on content and concepts from these lectures and assignments to create my shop simulation. I also did research which I references in my report.pdf. 

<br>

## Conclusion

I feel this project helped me learn about different programming paradigms. It also got me to think about what the best way to write certain programmes might be and in what language. Through the completion of this project I have displayed skills for writing in c, python procedural and python oop. I have also shown my ability to research and develop a project from scratch.
