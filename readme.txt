In my display menus I have 5 options. 

- The first option is to read in customer.csv. This just reads in and processes the provided csv file. 

- In the second option, the user can decided which customer csv they would like to process. I have four which are in a seperate folder labelled customers. 
Similarily to option one, each customer is read in and processed. However, each customer has an issue. 
Conor wants 400 Coke Cans and the shop only has 100.
Jack only has â‚¬2.63 in his budget and cannot afford his items. 
Peggy wants 400 Tomatoe Sauces and there are only 100.
And Sarah wants 66 Big bags when the shop only has 4 and she wants butter which is out of stock. 

- The third option is for the live shop. The user gets to choose one of the existing customers and the programmes writes their new budget and order to it all from the user input. 

- The fourth option displays the shop's stock. 

- And the fifth option exits the programme.
